1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?


2. Explain the differences between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
About setImmediate:
- setImmediate will be triggered during/next iteration
- setImmediate queues its callbacks on the event loop.
- Use setImmediate if you want to queue the function behind whatever I/O event callbacks that are already in the event queue. 
About process.nextTick:
- process.nextTick schedules a function to be executed when the current tick ends. 
- process.nextTick do not queues its callbacks on the event loop.
- process.nextTick run before setImmediate callbacks.
- Use process.nextTick to effectively queue the function at the head of the event queue so that it executes immediately after the current function completes.
